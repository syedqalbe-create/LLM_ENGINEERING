He played a crucial role in the early history of Islam and is considered one of the most important figures in Shia Islam.\\n\\nHussain ibn Ali was born in Medina, Arabia, to Imam Ali, the first Imam of Shia Islam, and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad. Hussain grew up in a family deeply rooted in Islamic values and became known for his piety, wisdom, and courage.\\n\\nIn 680 CE, Hussain led a caravan with his family and followers from Medina to Mecca, intending to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, he was confronted by the army of Yazid I, the Umayyad caliph who had seized power through treachery and usurpation. When Hussain refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid, a brutal battle ensued at Karbala, near modern-day Iraq.\\n\\nDespite being vastly outnumbered (around 72-100 men against an army of thousands), Hussain and his followers fought valiantly for several days before ultimately being defeated. On October 10, 680 CE, Hussain was beheaded, along with many members of his family, including his six-month-old son Ali al-Akbar.\\n\\nHussain's martyrdom is seen as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and oppression, and it has had a profound impact on Shia Islam. The event is commemorated annually during the Ashura ceremony, which takes place on the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram. It is considered a day of mourning, reflection, and remembrance.\\n\\nIn Sunni Islam, Hussain is also highly respected as a righteous and pious individual who sacrificed his life for his beliefs. His story has inspired countless Muslims across centuries, and he remains an iconic figure in Islamic history.\", 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [128006, 882, 128007, 271, 15546, 374, 80081, 467, 30, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 39, 1892, 467, 320, 18712, 12, 24132, 27809, 8, 574, 264, 85761, 15558, 36959, 11, 90408, 11, 323, 66955, 315, 279, 37728, 36831, 13, 1283, 6476, 264, 16996, 3560, 304, 279, 4216, 3925, 315, 15256, 323, 374, 6646, 832, 315, 279, 1455, 3062, 12678, 304, 78509, 15256, 382, 39, 1892, 467, 19185, 77, 14925, 574, 9405, 304, 85266, 11, 23931, 11, 311, 90912, 14925, 11, 279, 1176, 90912, 315, 78509, 15256, 11, 323, 26417, 7675, 11, 279, 10003, 315, 279, 37728, 36831, 13, 80081, 467, 14264, 709, 304, 264, 3070, 17693, 41976, 304, 15558, 2819, 323, 6244, 3967, 369, 813, 9115, 2676, 11, 24278, 11, 323, 25775, 382, 644, 220, 17814, 27809, 11, 80081, 467, 6197, 264, 74760, 449, 813, 3070, 323, 20723, 505, 85266, 311, 2206, 25445, 11, 85439, 311, 2804, 279, 84526, 73, 90413, 13, 4452, 11, 568, 574, 41782, 555, 279, 13695, 315, 89670, 307, 358, 11, 279, 549, 18864, 88, 329, 1652, 15619, 889, 1047, 31589, 2410, 1555, 4353, 613, 727, 323, 96188, 79, 367, 13, 3277, 80081, 467, 16436, 311, 36179, 68078, 311, 89670, 307, 11, 264, 28860, 8209, 96763, 520, 13528, 65, 6181, 11, 3221, 6617, 11477, 11340, 382, 20397, 1694, 53108, 85692, 291, 320, 20019, 220, 5332, 12, 1041, 3026, 2403, 459, 13695, 315, 9214, 705, 80081, 467, 323, 813, 20723, 21095, 1062, 5485, 398, 369, 3892, 2919, 1603, 13967, 1694, 24164, 13, 1952, 6664, 220, 605, 11, 220, 17814, 27809, 11, 80081, 467, 574, 387, 63600, 11, 3235, 449, 1690, 3697, 315, 813, 3070, 11, 2737, 813, 4848, 23086, 6418, 4538, 14925, 453, 6830, 74, 2308, 382, 39, 1892, 467, 596, 90408, 5717, 374, 3970, 439, 264, 7891, 315, 13957, 2403, 78001, 323, 47748, 11, 323, 433, 706, 1047, 264, 28254, 5536, 389, 78509, 15256, 13, 578, 1567, 374, 81154, 660, 30171, 2391, 279, 14937, 5808, 22260, 11, 902, 5097, 2035, 389, 279, 220, 605, 339, 1938, 315, 279, 15558, 2305, 315, 386, 12825, 1138, 309, 13, 1102, 374, 6646, 264, 1938, 315, 76350, 11, 22599, 11, 323, 1323, 72669, 382, 644, 56110, 15256, 11, 80081, 467, 374, 1101, 7701, 31387, 439, 264, 42805, 323, 281, 1245, 3927, 889, 67904, 813, 2324, 369, 813, 21463, 13, 5414, 3446, 706, 14948, 28701, 20071, 4028, 24552, 11, 323, 568, 8625, 459, 27373, 7216, 304, 15558, 3925, 13], 'total_duration': 108266877943, 'load_duration': 21884640761, 'prompt_eval_count': 15, 'prompt_eval_duration': 15275000000, 'eval_count': 384, 'eval_duration': 71088000000}\n"
